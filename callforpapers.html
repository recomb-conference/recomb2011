				 The 15th International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB 2011) will be held in Vancouver, Canada. RECOMB 2011 will provide a general forum for disseminating the latest research in bioinformatics and computational biology. As a multidisciplinary conference, it brings together academic and industrial scientists from molecular biology, medicine, computer science, mathematics, and statistics. Papers reporting on original research (both theoretical and experimental) in all areas of computational molecular biology are sought. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

                                    <ul>
				    <li> Molecular sequence analysis
				    <li> Recognition of genes and regulatory elements
				    <li> Molecular evolution
			 	    <li> Gene expression
			 	    <li> Biological networks
				    <li> Sequencing and genotyping technologies
				    <li> Genomics
				    <li> Population, statistical genetics
				    <li> Systems biology
				    <li> Imaging
			            <li> Computational proteomics
				    <li> Molecular structural biology

                                    </ul>

<p>
Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work.  The Program Committee will rigorously review submitted abstracts. Selected papers will be accepted for presentation at the conference. Accepted abstracts will be published as a proceedings volume in the <i>Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics</i> (LNBI) series from Springer-Verlag, which will be available at the conference. RECOMB is partnering with the <i>Journal of Computational Biology</i>. Select accepted papers will be invited, but not required, to submit an edited journal version for a special issue of JCB. Finally, RECOMB will also have a highlights track featuring presentations of exciting recent developments that have already appeared in journals within the past year. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Parallel Submission:</i>

Parallel submission is allowed. Authors who wish to publish the edited manuscript elsewhere must clearly indicate this at the time of submission to RECOMB, and submit a complete manuscript for review. If accepted for oral presentation at RECOMB, they can submit a final two-page extended abstract for inclusion in the LNBI proceedings in lieu of the full paper. Papers accepted for presentation that have been accepted to another journal will be moved to the Highlight track at the discretion of the PC.

</p>

                                  <p> <i>Genome Research:</i> We have an agreement 
                                    with Genome Research wherein a select set 
                                    of accepted papers that meet Genome Research 
                                    guidelines will be considered for concurrent 
                                    publication based on a parallel review process. 
                                    For consideration in GR, papers need to represent 
                                    cutting-edge computational biology of interest 
                                    to their broad readership, and also offering 
                                    significant biological insight. For more information 
                                    on the scope of Genome Research, please visit 
                                    genome.org. Authors selecting this option 
                                    must submit a full paper in the LNBI format, 
                                    and the work must not be submitted elsewhere. 
                                    The RECOMB PC will review and identify those 
                                    papers suitable for further consideration 
                                    by Genome Research. Genome Research will then 
                                    contact the author, pending Editorial review, 
                                    requesting online submission through the GR 
                                    site. They will have the opportunity to prepare 
                                    a revised version for a GR review.</p>

<p>
A manuscript should start with a succinct statement of the problem, the results achieved, their significance, and a comparison with previous work. This material should be understandable to non-specialists. A technical exposition directed to the specialist should follow. The length, excluding cover page and bibliography, should not exceed 10 pages. The manuscript should be easy to read, using at least 11 point font size on U.S. standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper with no less than one inch margin all around. If the authors believe that more details are absolutely necessary to substantiate the claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix, which might be read at the discretion of the reviewers. An email address for the contact author should be included. Manuscripts that deviate significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
