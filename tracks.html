                                  <p>RECOMB is adding a Highlights Track which 
                                    will feature PI presentations of exciting 
                                    developments that have already appeared in 
                                    journals within the past year. We invite the 
                                    submission of full papers that have been published, 
                                    or accepted for publication in 2010. Publications 
                                    that are &quot;in press&quot; and already 
                                    linked on the journal web site are also welcome. 
                                    A group of experts will select the papers 
                                    to be presented at the meeting, after considering 
                                    the impact of the work on the field, the likelihood 
                                    that the work will make a good presentation, 
                                    and the relevance to biomedical research. 
                                    Accepted presenters for the Highlights Track 
                                    are required to make the presentation themselves, 
                                    and must register and pay to attend the conference.</p>
                                  <p>Submissions should include a 300-word abstract-like 
                                    argument that explains how the work of the 
                                    submitted paper(s) is impacting the field. 
                                    More details are given below.</p>

                                  <p>All submissions will be evaluated by a group 
                                    of editors on the program committee. In the 
                                    submitted abstract, the authors should add 
                                    a line identifying the RECOMB 2011 program 
                                    committee member(s) most suitable to review 
                                    their work. All papers published in peer-review 
                                    journals (no book chapters) published in 2010 
                                    are eligible to be presented as talks. Papers 
                                    in press are acceptable only if already available 
                                    through the journal web site. Note that presenters 
                                    are encouraged to also present more recent 
                                    work; however, that work will not be considered 
                                    in the decision. Up to 2 papers can be submitted 
                                    as one single PDF if the authors intend to 
                                    present the results of multiple qualifying 
                                    papers. The PC chair will notify authors of 
                                    the acceptance by <strong>January 31st, 2011</strong>.</p>
                                  <p>The selected Highlights will be presented 
                                    in a main session at RECOMB 2011. All presentations 
                                    will have to be completed within 15 minutes 
                                    and will be followed by 5-minute discussions. 
                                    While presenters are expected to focus mostly 
                                    on the chosen paper(s), short infusions of 
                                    more recent results are welcome.</p>
